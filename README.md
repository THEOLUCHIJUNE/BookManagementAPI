# BookManagementAPI
This is a Book Management Api where the publishers table has a one to many relationship with the books table. 
Here, you add the publishers first as this is the parent table before adding books using the publisher ID first given by the application when adding the piblisher.
I also tried securing the WebAPI with JWT token.
I could register users and this data logs into the Authentication Database.
I could also authenticate users and hence, produce a token which authenticated users could log in with and have access to the API.
